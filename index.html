                <h1>Sameera Rachakonda</h1>
                <h2>Hello! Welcome to my corner of the internet (:</h2>
                <p>My name is Sameera Rachakonda and I am a 22 year old writer, artist, and software engineer based in Philadelphia, PA. 
                    In all of my pursuits, whether it's writing, coding, or something else entirely, I aim to use my knowledge to create and inspire positive change in the world. 
                    I am endlessly fascinated by how art and computer science can be used to solve some of the most pressing social, economic, and political hardships in the world today. 
                    We are living in an unprecendented time and I am determined and curious to use my privelege and knowledge to make a change.
                    I graduated from Temple University with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
                    In college and since graduating, I've worked on projects that focus on using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science for good.
                    Additionally, since I was little, I've always had a passion for writing and throughout the years, I've written a collection of poetry, prose, short stories, creative nonfiction, and songs.
                    Here you can find samples of writing I have had published along with personal pieces I've written on my blog hosted by Substack.
                    Thank you for taking the time to check out my work. If you have any questions or just want to say hi, please contact me!
